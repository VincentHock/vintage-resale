Welcome to IKO! The idea behind this project was to create a one stop shop to buy and sell vintage clothing, making thrift shopping more accessible. Our project is meant to be compiled, configured, and used within the CS50 IDE using the "flask run" command within the terminal. 

Upon running flask, you will be directed to IKO's login page. You will first need to register an account by clicking the "register" button in the top right corner and filling in the required information. After registering, you will be sent to the log in page where you can enter your username and password to enter IKO.

After logging in, you will be directed to the home page in which there will be a menu bar at the top with the options: "List", "Search", "Browse", Our IKO logo, "Watchlist", "About", and "Profile".

"List" allows you to list an item on the market. Our site accepts a variety of picture files (png, jpg, jpeg, gif). Add short descriptions of your item in the text boxes and specify certain filters for your item. If you do not enter an item, the site will flash an error and ask you to resubmit. After listing an item, it will appear in both browse and in your profile. Additionally, it will appear in any searches that match the item.

"Search" allows you to search for clothes by filtering by a multitude of filters. Leaving any field blank 
will result in no filtration based off that category. If color is left blank, for example, items of all colors will show.

"Browse" allows you to simply browse through current listings, in order of recency. There is no filter on the browse page, as it is just a place to look  at things that people are currently posting. If you see something you like, you can either add the item to your watchlist to buy later or click buy to buy the item (for the purposes of this demonstration all users have a default fund amount of $200). If you see something you like that is out of your price range, you can navigate to profile to add more funds.

The circular button with our IKO logo in the middle will take you back to the home page. 

"Watchlist" is where all the items that you added to the watchlist will appear. The watchlist is a place to view items that you are interested and have flagged. You can remove an item from your watchlist or buy an item at any time.

"About" is where you can find more information about our company and its co-founders. You can also find our emails if you would like to contact us.

"Profile" is where you can edit information about yourself, see your listings, view the current status of your listings, remove listings, deposit additional funds, and log out of your profile.
